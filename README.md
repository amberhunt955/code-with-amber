<h1 align="center" id="readme-top">Code with Amber</h1>

<p align="center">Welcome to my blog!</p>

## Purpose

Code with Amber is my professional blog where I combine my programming and writing skills to develop and maintain site code, manage deployment, and create informative, engaging posts.

## Technologies Used

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vite-c1d6d6?logo=vite&style=for-the-badge)

## Future Improvements

This site is currently frontend only and the data has been entered manually. I would like to build a database for my blog posts and eventual guest comments.

I'll also be tweaking the design to ensure it is fully responsive across all devices.

## Project Link

This site is deployed on [Netlify](https://codewithamber.netlify.app).
