<p align="center">Welcome to my professional blog!</p>

## Purpose

I created this blog to give employers a clearer picture of my continued learning journey after graduating from Per Scholas.

## Technologies Used

## Future Improvements

As I've only just created this site, it is currently frontend only and the data has been entered manually. My most immediate goal is to code the backend, connecting my blog to a database and implementing full CRUD for posts.

I'll also be tweaking the design to ensure it is fully responsive across all devices.
