        Hi there, and welcome to my new blog, <strong>Code with Amber!</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Just over a week ago, I graduated from a MERN stack program at Per
        Scholas. I am now embarking on a full-time, self-paced learning journey
        as I search for my first role in software development.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, what have I been up to since graduating?
        <br />
        <br />
        Here's a quick summary:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Connecting with climate leaders:</strong> On May 6th I
            attended the GiveBackLabs climate tech event here in Columbus. I had
            a chance to learn from local climate leaders and work alongside
            other tech-driven members of our community to brainstorm solutions
            to climate issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cybersecurity presentation:</strong> I'm always on the
            lookout for ways to expand my knowledge, so I attended a
            presentation on cybersecurity at one of my favorite local tech
            meetups, Code and Coffee, on May 13th.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fine-tuning old projects and building a new app:</strong> I
            revisited few of my projects, working to clean up the code and add
            better comments. I also created a simple app I named <a href="https://github.com/amberhunt955/vite-recipe-app" target="blank">Menu Magic</a>,
            which pulls data from an API to display random recipes to users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exploring tech ethics:</strong> One of my biggest interests
            is humane tech, so I've been working through the Foundations of
            Humane Technology course.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Seeking feedback and applying to jobs:</strong> I've been
            reaching out to various members of the tech community, asking for
            advice on my learning journey, project ideas, and overall job search
            tips. Meanwhile, I'm also applying to jobs non-stop, hoping to find
            a role that allows for ample growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taking care of my furry friends:</strong> I'm making sure to
            give my cats plenty of love and attention. They're always there to
            help me unwind after a long day of coding, so it's the least I can
            do!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating and deploying this blog:</strong> Last but not
            least: I designed this blog and wrote my first post!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I'm excited to share this journey with you and see where it takes us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates!
